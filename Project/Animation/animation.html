Animation - Make an animated scene

Please set the viewport as follows

 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 

You can use still images, if that is easier for you. But if you want to be more creative and 
learn about Sprite Sheets or working with Animated GIFs on a Canvas, this can be more challenging.

Have a background.
    Have talk bubbles appear for people/animals/vechicles to say things.
    Change or reposition some items in your scene in different frames. 

Make an animated scene lasting several seconds that repeats in an endless loop.

Try to tell some sort of story.

To make things easier, have functions that move the various parts in your scene.

Might be useful to use JSON Array values to hold the positions/text/attributes of the items in your 
scene. And then go through a loop using those values to display the content.

Optional, more advanced features. 

Animating Sprite Sheets
    MOST USEFUL: Very helpful tool(https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter) to cutup a sprite sheet. 
                 Might be useful to combine with this site to rebuild the sprite sheet and 
                 get JSON values for the pieces.

    Useful tool to Split(https://ezgif.com/split) an Animated GIF into single frames
    
    Find images and sprite sheets online to mix and match to make an animated scene on the canvas.
    
    Convert some animated GIFs online into a sprite sheet(https://ezgif.com/gif-to-sprite).

    If you like to draw, you can make your own sprite sheet from this website
    (https://www.codeandweb.com/free-sprite-sheet-packer).
        Also available as a standalone program(https://www.codeandweb.com/sprite-sheet-maker).
