<!-- 
Using a HTML5 Canvas & JavaScript, draw some cartoon on the screen using moveTo, lineTo, 
fill, stroke, and other JavaScript canvas functions.

Add a link from your portfolio page to the cartoon.
Cartoon page must have a title. Include a link under the canvas to return to your main page.
You should use an external JS file for your JavaScript code.
Comment the different sections of your cartoon using JS comments, so that someone can easily 
understand what is being drawn.

Your cartoon should include
Some caption text (must be written on the canvas!)
Background color
Sun, Moon, Clouds, Water, Mountains, Trees, and/or other background objects
Ground color
Living Quarters with details (windows, door, etc). Could be a boat, tent, house, spaceship, etc.
Use a for loop to draw grass, rocks, fence, ladder, or some other receptive item in the cartoon.
Helpful sites:

Refer to the HTML5 book Chapter 8 for details on how to draw.
